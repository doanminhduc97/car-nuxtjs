1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,770
So now let's go ahead and actually start populating this with all of the components that we need.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,320
So, of course, we first need the nav bar.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,020
So let's go over to our file.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,510
And we have already well created that nav bar component so we can just now very simply just say nav

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,000
bar.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,770
So we can say nav bar like so.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,200
And now we should see our nav bar.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,090
And now what we need to do is all the other HTML elements for our component.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,060
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the car's HTML.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,740
You can see here where we have the car page.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,550
I'm going to go ahead and just copy everything between the car page comments.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,500
So let's go ahead and just copy that.

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,130
And we're going to go over here to make and we're going to go ahead and paste that in.

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,870
And there we go.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,630
So now you can see we have this and we only have one card for now.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,660
But later on, we'll render more.

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,120
Now, of course, what I want to also do is separate a lot of these things into their own component.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,710
So let's begin with the car sidebar.

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:09,270
So over here, let's just grab everything in between the car sidebar and we're just going to go ahead

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,530
and just cut it out for now.

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,710
This is going to be this thing right over here.

22
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,000
And we're going to go to we're going to go over here.

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,720
We're going to go inside of the components directory, inside of car.

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:30,660
We're going to create a side bar view file and we're going to say templates and we're going to go ahead

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,790
and just paste that in there.

26
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:41,730
And then over here we're going to call car sidebar, very simple car side bar like.

27
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,970
So we can also remove these comments.

28
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,710
Okay, so that looks pretty good to me.

29
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,390
So I'm going to go ahead and just save that.

30
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,000
And now we have we still have everything looking the same.

31
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,140
Another thing that I do want to add now is two more components.

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,080
One for the car cards and then one for the car card, the actual card itself.

33
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,910
So the card cards is actually going to be a one div component.

34
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,960
So let's go over here and let's go over here.

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,110
We're going to say cards.

36
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,710
So this is plural.

37
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:21,410
And then over here we'll also create another one, which is going to be card singular.

38
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,860
All right, So let's go over here for the cards.

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,210
It's just one div element right over here, which is going to be v full.

40
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,290
So cards, we're just say template and then V full.

41
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,160
That's it.

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,180
And then for the cards, we're going to grab everything in here.

43
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,360
Just grab all of that.

44
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,770
Let's cut that out and let's just create a template and we're going to go ahead and paste that in there.

45
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,290
And then inside of the cards, we're going to render that just one card for now.

46
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,300
So we're going to say core card like so.

47
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:04,830
And so now over here, we can actually completely get rid of all of this and very simply just say car

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,940
and then card and then save that.

49
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,270
And theoretically, that should be it.

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,640
So you can see here that everything is working A-OK.

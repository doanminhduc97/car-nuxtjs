1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,900
So now that we are completely done with the home page, let us move on to the next page.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,990
And that is going to be whenever we search for a particular city.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,040
So let's say Ottawa.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,530
In my case, I'm going to go ahead and click search.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,070
It's going to take me to this page over here.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,570
Now, this page is going to have the path of slash city slash Ottawa slash car.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,530
Now, the reason why Ottawa is in green is because this over here is going to be dynamic and is going

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,540
to be dependent on whatever the user has decided to type.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,980
So if they didn't type Ottawa, instead, they typed Toronto and we went ahead and looked at the route.

10
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,830
You can see now it's slash city slash Toronto slash car.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,430
So you can see that this portion is always dynamic.

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,030
And so we need to figure out a way to add this dynamic path within our NOx application.

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,340
Now, slash city and also slash car are going to be static.

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,590
They're always going to be the same.

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,910
Now, another thing that I also want to note is that whenever we actually go to the car page and then

16
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,550
we change the make of the car.

17
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,190
So for example, let's say I change the make to I don't know what's a nice car, let's change it to

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,080
Toyota.

19
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,680
It's also going to change the path of our application.

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,250
So it's going to end up looking something like this.

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,240
So slash city slash auto slash car slash Toyota.

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,270
So this again, is going to be dynamic.

23
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,380
It could be Toyota, it could be Ferrari, it could be Bentley, it could be Hyundai.

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,750
However, however, it is also going to be optional.

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,780
So if we actually don't provide the make and we just have something like this, we should also have

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,420
the exact same page.

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,420
So whether we have the actual make as well or we don't have to make it is going to present us with the

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,150
exact same page, meaning that this is not only dynamic, it is also optional.

29
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,410
So we have to actually think about that when writing our rules.

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,169
Now, of course, we're not going to write any code for this.

31
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,740
We're going to just create a bunch of files and folders.

32
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:22,020
So I'm going to go over here and within the pages directory I'm going to create a bunch of other directories

33
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,900
that are going to follow this path over here.

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,120
So for example, I'm going to go over here and I'm going to create a directory.

35
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,870
Actually, let's just create a file for now and I'm going to call this city dot view.

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,840
We're going to delete this later, but just for demonstration purposes.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,080
So I'm going to create this right over here, City View and I'm going to do a template div H one and

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,370
then city.

39
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,470
So go ahead and save that.

40
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:53,160
And now what ends up happening is if I go to my application and then I don't go to the slash index route,

41
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,710
instead I go to the slash city route.

42
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:01,980
You can see that I get a 404, which I was not expecting, and that's probably because I'm going to

43
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,090
have to go ahead and just close this terminal down and open it up again.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:14,680
And that's probably what you have to do most of the time whenever you change your page's route.

45
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,290
So the hot reloading is not very smart.

46
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,820
In that case.

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,860
Let's just go ahead and just quickly do a little refresh here.

48
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,440
And there we go.

49
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,300
You can see now I actually have the city page.

50
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,740
So now, of course, I can go back to the home page.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,370
I can go back to the slash city page.

52
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,570
And I went to this page over here, which doesn't exist.

53
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,050
So that's why we got this error.

54
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:41,350
But if I go back to just city on its own, I go and I see this so you can see that this is where we're

55
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,030
going to create all of our different routing rules within this page's directory.

56
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,900
We're going to create a bunch of folders and files to specify those rules.

57
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,600
So what I want to do is I want to have something like this.

58
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,910
I want to have and let me get rid of this for now.

59
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,910
I want to have something like Slash City, and then I want this part to be dynamic.

60
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,530
So whatever this city is.

61
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,350
So typically we would define that by doing something like this.

62
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:12,370
So slash city and then slash car and then I want to have the make, but again, I want this to be optional.

63
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,960
So how are we going to do that?

64
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,230
Well, let me go ahead and create another directory now.

65
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,750
And this time is going to be a folder, not a file.

66
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,560
A folder.

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,630
So I'm going to go over here.

68
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm going to say city, and then I'm going to say or actually, well, we're going to say city in here.

69
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,990
We're going to create that one city folder.

70
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,580
And then within this city folder, we're going to create another folder and that's going to mark the

71
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,330
actual city.

72
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,630
So whether it's Ottawa, Toronto, Los Angeles, whatever.

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Now, this is going to be a dynamic path.

74
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,630
So how do we specify something to be dynamic and not static like this over here?

75
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,170
Well, to specify something as dynamic, we wrap them in square braces.

76
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,060
So over here we're just going to say city are we're going to wrap it in square braces and city is just

77
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,710
going to be the variable name.

78
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,570
So over here now we got that.

79
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,600
So we've got city slash the dynamic city.

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,990
And now what I want to do is I want to create, well, another folder.

81
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,820
This time it's going to be car.

82
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,630
And then at the very end, this one's actually going to be a file.

83
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,740
So we can actually well, create our HTML elements.

84
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:21,850
So right over here we're going to say file and this one is going to be MC like so and it's going to

85
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,870
be dynamic.

86
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,570
So we're going to say make dot view like.

87
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,110
So.

88
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,050
However, not only do we want it to be dynamic, we want it to be optional.

89
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:39,730
Now, to make it dynamic and optional, very simply, we wrap it with double double square braces like

90
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,240
so.

91
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
So now we can go ahead and actually add that in.

92
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,950
And I'm going to go ahead and actually just remove this.

93
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,330
We do not need this anymore.

94
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,860
The city.

95
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,980
So right over here, we actually added this path.

96
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,150
So I'm going to go over here.

97
00:05:52,150 --> 00:06:00,490
I'm just going to say template div, I'm going to say city and make for now and let's go.

98
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,460
We might have to refresh our page so now we can see we're getting a 500.

99
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,770
Let me just go ahead and just refresh our terminal.

100
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,090
And now what we're going to do is we're going to go to slash city and then slash whatever.

101
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,690
Doesn't matter what it is.

102
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:22,720
Well, let's just put something a little bit reasonable, like let's say Houston and then slash and

103
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,800
then core.

104
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,170
And that should take us to this HTML template over here, because again, this portion right here is

105
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,090
dynamic.

106
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:37,690
Now, we can also, if we wanted to go to slash city, slash Houston slash car, slash Toyota, and

107
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,930
that should also take us to the exact same page.

108
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,000
So let's go ahead and give this a quick shot.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,080
So we're going to go over here.

110
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,180
We can see we're getting a 400 for page.

111
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,230
I'm going to go now to slash city slash Houston slash car.

112
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,510
And you can see we get city and make and now I'm going to go to slash city, slash Houston slash car

113
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,710
slash Toyota.

114
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,690
And today we get the exact same thing.

115
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,100
All right.

116
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,180
So we have created that path.

117
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,260
We have created it.

118
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,470
So now what we actually need to do is start populating it with components.

119
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,870
So let's actually do that in the next video.

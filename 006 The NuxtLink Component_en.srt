1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,110
Now that we have created all of our different pages, I want to have the ability to navigate within

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:13,740
these pages, within the actual application itself, and not have to well redirect to whatever page

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,940
I want to go to.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,740
So, for example, if I want to go to that slash city slash dynamic city name over here, if I want

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,240
to go to this page, what I don't want to do is actually have to type that into the URL itself.

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,540
What I want to do is I want to just say auto search and have it move me there itself.

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,460
Another thing that I would like is to have this nav bar be functional.

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:43,770
So whenever I click on this, I would very much like it for it to go back to the home page.

9
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,120
So let's actually begin with the naff bar, because that's, that's actually the simplest thing that

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,460
we can do right now.

11
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,730
So the nav bar.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,310
Very simply, whenever we click on this, I just want it to go back to the slash root, the home page.

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,930
And what we can do to do that is we can go to our nav bar components.

14
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,310
So let's go to our nav bar components right over here.

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,810
And what we can do here is we can actually make the rough slash so we can make it slash h ref.

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,020
And now when I go over here, you can see that it takes me back to this page.

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:24,960
However, just like in view, where when we ever add an H ref, instead of adding a view link or a view

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,810
a route or link, instead of using that, what it's going to do is it's going to refresh our page,

19
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,230
which is not that great.

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,720
So instead what we're going to do is we're going to use a built in Nux component called Nux link.

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,970
So Nux link right over here.

22
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,420
And that's going to allow us to navigate across pages but not have to refresh our page every time.

23
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,790
And it does start with something called universal rendering, which we'll talk about a little bit later.

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,670
So we're going to change the ref from not being a ref, but instead to two.

25
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,820
And notice that we didn't have to import this in.

26
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,510
Again, this is something that was auto imported.

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,250
So now if I go ahead and actually save this and let me go to another page now, let's go to this page

28
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:15,660
and then if I go over here, you can see it got redirected back to this page, which is terrific.

1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,870
In this video.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,060
What I would like to do is populate this page with all of the necessary components, like the nav bar

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,760
component as well as the hero.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,730
So let's actually go over here and we're going to have to actually start creating some of these components.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,670
And let's begin with the nav bar, which is going to be by far the simplest thing that we have thus

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,180
far.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,890
So I'm going to go ahead and create another directory and I'm going to call this directory components.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,590
Now, the name of this is also extremely important because we're going to place all of our components

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,280
in here.

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,710
And as soon as we place Vue files in here, Knox is actually going to know that they're components because

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,270
they're inside of this directory right over here.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,420
And it's going to do some special magic that we're going to see a little bit later.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,110
So I want to go over here and I'm going to create a nav bar dot view file.

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,330
And we actually already well wrote out the nav bar HTML.

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,110
So if we go to the home page, we can just go ahead and just grab this right over here.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,970
So where over here, you can see it starts out enough, bar ends and nav bar.

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:11,370
So just grab this HTML as well as CSS, and then we're going to go over to our nav bar.

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,790
We're going to create a templates and we're going to go ahead and just paste this in right over here.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,820
So this is our nav bar.

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,760
And now what I want to do is I actually want to use it within the index dot view file.

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,640
So typically what we would do is we would actually import in that nav bar component.

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,540
So we would have some sort of script tag right over here.

23
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:41,190
We'll say script setup and we would just say very simply, import nav bar, and then we can say from

24
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,620
we'll move back to directory, we'll go components and we'll just say nav bar, and then right over

25
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,300
here we can just go ahead and just render this Navarre component.

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,160
So that's typically what we would do.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,990
And you can see that this still works.

28
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,110
The cell is a viable solution.

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,810
However, we actually do not need to do all of this inside of a Knox application.

30
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:11,430
And that's because whenever we place something within the components directory, Knox is going to understand

31
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,950
that it is indeed a component.

32
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,130
And whenever we actually just go ahead and render that component within a page or another component,

33
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,760
it is going to go ahead and auto import for us.

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,890
So over here I can actually remove all of this bloat and I can just go ahead and save this.

35
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,500
And it's going to be smart enough to basically will do this under the hood.

36
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,340
So we're going to go ahead and just save that.

37
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,960
And now just to prove to you that we still have our nav bar Tata, we still have our nav bar.

38
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:48,360
This is pretty incredible and can make our code significantly cleaner.

39
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:48,930
All right.

40
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,590
So now let's actually go ahead and do the exact same thing, but this time for the car hero.

41
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,550
So I'm going to go ahead and create another another component.

42
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,100
And I'm going to call this car hero.

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:09,590
I'm going to say car hero dot view, and I am going to go over to where are we?

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,070
I'm going to go over to the home page and I'm going to grab this car hero.

45
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,190
So you can see here we have this comment here saying car hero.

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,800
We also have this end comment that also says car hero.

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:29,250
So we could just grab all of the HTML within that and just copy that and we can go over to Car Hero

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,890
and we can go ahead and just create a template and just paste in all of that HTML.

49
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,560
And now very simply, look at this.

50
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:45,240
I can just go here and just say Car Hero, the exact same name of the file, and then tada, we get

51
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,160
our car hero.

52
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,530
How cool is that?

53
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,870
Now, one thing that I actually also want to do is I want to separate this home search bar.

54
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,370
So if you go to our final or if we go to this version over here, actually, I want to separate this

55
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,500
search bar into its own component, because this search bar has quite a bit of functionality within

56
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,250
itself.

57
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,200
And I would like to kind of isolate it.

58
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,940
So let's go ahead and do that.

59
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,190
That should be pretty easy.

60
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,700
I'm going to call this car search bar.

61
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,930
Or going say doctor view.

62
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,150
And then over here, I'm going to go ahead and just kind of cut everything within this.

63
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,560
So within this comments, let's just go ahead and just cut everything out.

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,110
And we can also we'll cut this out a little bit later.

65
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,300
We're going to create a template.

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,410
And then over here, we're going to create that car search bar.

67
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,730
And now this time, we're inside of a component, not a page.

68
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,230
We can still treat it.

69
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,480
We can still basically do the exact same thing.

70
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:52,020
We can just say here now car search bar, and we can go ahead and just save that.

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,040
And if I were to go back to my application, it still renders that search bar.

72
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,670
And if I were to, of course, comment it out, just to prove to you, let's go ahead and just comment

73
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,030
this out.

74
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,320
You can see that it is gone.

75
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,010
Tada!

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,730
Awesome.

77
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,240
All right.

78
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,290
So now we can just remove this.

79
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,670
We don't need that anymore.

80
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:15,440
So one thing that I also want to quickly note is that you can see here that within our component directory,

81
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,680
it seems that for at least for these two components here, we have kind of a very similar naming structure.

82
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,330
So we have car and then hero car and then search bar.

83
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,890
And later on we're going to have a lot of other components are going to follow that exact same naming

84
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:36,490
structure like car card or car sidebar or whatever.

85
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,170
So one thing that's actually nice is that what we can do if we have this naming convention where we

86
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:47,660
always start off with the exact same name and then we have other different names after it, what we

87
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:55,490
can do is we can actually create a directory called car within our components file or components folder.

88
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:03,560
And then over here we can actually remove the car from these files so we can just say instead of hero,

89
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,010
we can say or instead of car hero, we can just say hero.

90
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,570
Let's just skip these changes.

91
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,470
It's fine.

92
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,490
We can just go ahead and actually move that in here now.

93
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,040
So I'm going to go ahead and just move that in there and we're going to do the exact same thing here.

94
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,130
Let's go ahead and just change that and we're going to move that in there.

95
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,260
And we're gonna say, okay, and now this is actually going to behave the exact same way.

96
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,660
The names is actually going to be exactly the same.

97
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,700
It's still going to be Car Hero, even though our file now is just hero.

98
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,280
And that's because what ends up happening in the component directory is if we want to specify a specific

99
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,300
file that is nested, we would have to append both names together.

100
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,920
So both names together, so be car hero and then car search bar.

101
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,880
That's pretty neat.

102
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,310
And if I were to go back here, of course, if I were to refresh, everything is working a okay.

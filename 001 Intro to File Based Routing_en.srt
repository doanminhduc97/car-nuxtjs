1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,939
So whether you have built the UI elements with me or you have completely skipped that section and downloaded

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:12,890
the source code, you should have this code right over here, opened up inside of a code editor.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,050
So this right here is a typical Knox application.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,350
It is completely boilerplate and empty.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,610
All that we have here is this HTML directory that contains three different HTML files that is going

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:33,720
to contain all of our HTML as well as our CSS for all of the different pages and components within our

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,680
application.

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,080
So now let's actually go ahead and start adding it within our Knox application.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,840
So let's go over here and do an NPM install.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,230
If you haven't done that already and you don't have your node modules and then do an MPM run dev inside

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:56,580
of your terminal, So go over here and do an MPM, run dev in order to run your application.

12
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,500
Now, as soon as you run your application, you can see here that it tells you the ports that it is

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,630
going to listen on.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,330
Now I already have port 3000 being used so for me it actually allocated 3002.

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,670
However, for you it will probably be 3000 if it is indeed not used.

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,760
Nonetheless, you can just go over here and figure out exactly what it is.

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,720
So now what you can do is you can go to localhost 3002 for me.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,830
And you can see here that there is a completely empty page.

19
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,030
And now what we want to do is we want to add multiple pages within our application.

20
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,380
Because you can see here, if I were to go to the home page, you can see that we have this home page

21
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,400
right over here.

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,490
If I go ahead and search, it takes me to this page.

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,530
And then if I go over here and let's say I click on this porch, it takes me to another page.

24
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,950
So what we need to do is add routing within our Nook's application, and we're going to begin very,

25
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,060
very simply with routing for the home page.

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,260
And this is going to have a very specific route of slash.

27
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,750
So just the home page is as soon as we write the domain and we don't have any other paths, we want

28
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,660
to hit this home page right over here and show the nav bar as well as the car hero.

29
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,090
So that is exactly what we want to do.

30
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,480
So again, once we go to local host 3000 and then there's no other paths, that is what we want to hit.

31
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,830
So let's actually go back to our Nook's application right over here.

32
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:30,060
And you can see within our Nook's application we only actually have one view file, which is the app

33
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:37,050
dot view, and I can go right over here and I could just say H one and I can say hello like so.

34
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,570
And if I were to go back to my application and were to zoom in a little bit, you can see that we get

35
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,310
Hello, which is nice.

36
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,640
Okay, so it seems that the home page, we have to add all of our different components within this page

37
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,980
right over here or this file right here.

38
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,410
But that's actually not the case.

39
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:04,500
So what happens if I go to, let's say, local host, 3002 slash cars, for example, if I were to enter

40
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,100
this, you can see I still get hello.

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:15,480
And if I were to go to another path, slash whatever, I still get this component and this app dot view

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,200
file.

43
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,630
So this app dot view file is going to be a very temporary file that we're going to have.

44
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,860
And what it does is it just well, it matches with all different routes.

45
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,920
It treats our application kind of like a single page application and it matches every single particular

46
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,430
route.

47
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,010
And it's like we don't even have routing at all.

48
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:42,870
If we do want to add routing, what we're going to do is not define any code like we do in view, but

49
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:50,000
instead what we're going to do is add a folder, a very specific folder in the root directory of our

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,180
Linux application.

51
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:59,910
And this folder is going to be called pages, and it absolutely needs to be called pages because Knox

52
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,520
is going to understand exactly what this folder is doing and it's going to treat all of the different

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,710
files within it very specifically so that it can add routing to our app.

54
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,900
So over here we're going to add pages.

55
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,800
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new file called Index Dot View, and this is

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:27,450
actually going to be the new component that is going to be rendered whenever we go to the home page.

57
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,620
Root So whenever we go to the home page, which is just going to be the slash root, we're going to

58
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,780
render this index dot view.

59
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,250
So let's go over here and I'm going to go ahead and just grab this template.

60
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,540
I'm going to go ahead and paste it in here and we're just going to have our typical hello.

61
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,510
So let's go back over here and let's just see what happens.

62
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,380
So now you can see right away that we're getting some sort of error.

63
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:56,070
And what I highly suggest you do is whenever we create something like this, let's just close our our

64
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,800
terminal and run back the Linux again.

65
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,640
And so let's refresh this.

66
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,250
So as soon as I refresh, you can see we're getting the loading state, blah, blah, blah.

67
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,250
Come on.

68
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,230
Come on.

69
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,320
They could forever.

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,440
And there we go.

71
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,740
So you can see right away.

72
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,850
Now, when I go to this random route, we're actually getting a 404 page, which is pretty interesting.

73
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,870
So let's actually go over here now to local host 3002.

74
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,680
And now you can see that we have this.

75
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,290
Hello.

76
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,540
Whenever I go to again, another path, we get a404 page.

77
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,730
So it seems as though that this file based routing is indeed working.

78
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,400
Now, one thing that we can actually do here is within the app view, what we can do is we can add a

79
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,380
Knox page component, and this right here is going to be a very specific component that is going to

80
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,850
detect exactly what view file it needs to render.

81
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,070
So this Nook's page is going to figure out what path that we're in.

82
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,470
If we are on the slash path, then it's going to go look at the page's directory.

83
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:10,020
It's going to look for the indexed view and it's going to go ahead and render this right over here.

84
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,020
So it's going to render this component here.

85
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,130
And why this is nice is that now what we can do is we can add other things on top of it or below it.

86
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,830
So for example, we can add a nav bar, So we're going to say here, nav.

87
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,050
And then over here, we can add a footer.

88
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,300
So footer like so we can say footer like that.

89
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:38,070
So now we can have nav and then hello and then footer like so, so we can actually kind of customize

90
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,290
exactly what we have.

91
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,390
But for now we'll just leave it like this with the Nux page.

92
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,620
So that's pretty much it.

93
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,650
But of course now we need to go ahead and actually populate our components or our, our page with these

94
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,870
components with this nav bar that's humongous and have to zoom out so you can actually see it well.

95
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,270
So it's nav bar as well as this hero.

96
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,070
So let's do that in the next video.

1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,070
So we created this file.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,960
However, we have a pretty major problem.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,600
And the last section I told you that this is going to be an error file that all different errors are

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,340
eventually going to render.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,550
So it's always going to render this template right over here.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,900
So it's not necessarily always going to be a 404 error.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,200
You could just have a 400 error or a 403 error or some other error that we can potentially have.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,060
And it's also not necessarily always going to be a page not found error.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:41,360
So right over here, it's not really a good idea to have these values be static.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,020
Instead, they should be dynamic depending on the error.

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,260
And how can we accomplish this?

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,010
Well, we can accomplish this by utilizing the use error composable.

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,020
So this is a built in composable that we can auto import and it's going to give us information about

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,550
the error that we currently have.

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:10,590
So I can say here const error is equal to use error and again this is a built in composable and this

16
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,660
right here is going to give us an error object that's going to have a bunch of different different information.

17
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,450
Now, specifically, one piece of information that we really need is the status code.

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,300
So I'm going to say error status code.

19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,710
And then right over here I can also say error dot message.

20
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,140
So I'm going to go ahead and actually save this.

21
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,220
And now let's go to a different URL.

22
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,290
And you can see we pretty much get the exact same thing.

23
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,790
We still get a 404.

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,710
We've got actually a nicer message page not found and it tells us exactly what the route is.

25
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,890
But now this is dynamic so we can actually reuse this throughout our app.

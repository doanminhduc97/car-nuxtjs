1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,560
The last page that we need to work on is this page right over here.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,880
So whenever I click on a particular car, I get redirected to the car details page, and this actually

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,690
has a very unique path within itself and this is the path that it has.

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,910
So it's going to be slash car.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,380
This part is static.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:31,220
It's always going to be slash car, but then it's going to be slash and then the name of the car.

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,010
In this case, it's Pausch.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,240
And then we have a dash that is always going to be there.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,130
It's static.

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:42,530
And then also we're going to have another dynamic ID So it's going to be the name of the car, which

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:52,160
is going to be dynamic a a static dash and then a dynamic ID and that's all within this same exact route.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,530
So I actually highly suggest that you just try to figure out how to out how to do this on your own,

13
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,500
and then we'll proceed with this video.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,690
So I'll give you a quick chance to pause the video.

15
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,190
Go ahead and pause it.

16
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,100
I assume at this point you have paused it and tried.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,710
So let's go ahead and show you exactly how to do it.

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,390
So we're going to go over here and now we're going to go to the pages directory.

19
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,480
So remember, the static part is going to be slash car.

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,840
So we're going to create a new folder called Car.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:28,400
And then within here it's going to be slash car and then slash that actual car and then dash ID.

22
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:33,380
So over here, what we're going to do is we're going to create a new file and to specify that this is

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,490
going to be dynamic.

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,460
We're going to say square braces name.

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,210
And then right after the Square braces, we're going to add a dash.

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,970
Then we're going to add another set of square braces.

27
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,880
And that's going to be the ID dot view.

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,620
And that's exactly how we do it.

29
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,600
Very, very simple stuff.

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
And you can see how powerful and easy this is becoming.

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,550
So over here we can create a template.

32
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,610
And now let's actually go ahead and create everything it is that we need.

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,990
So we need the nav bar.

34
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,040
So let's go over here.

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,120
Let's add the nav bar, let's go ahead and save that.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,520
And now I'm going to go to the car detail page and I'm just going to copy everything within here.

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,230
So let's just copy everything here and we'll separate them into components in a moment.

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,790
So let's go over here.

39
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,550
Let's go to the car detail page.

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,700
Go ahead and save that and let's see if this is working A-OK now.

41
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:32,570
So I'm going to go to slash car and then slash and I'm going to say I'm going to say slash Toyota doesn't

42
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,640
really matter and then slash five.

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,660
And if I enter that, you can see we actually get the page.

44
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,480
So it does indeed work.

45
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,420
Now, let's go ahead and quickly separate them into their own separate components.

46
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,080
So let's go over here, the car hero itself.

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,830
So we're going to go ahead and grab this and let's go here.

48
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,040
Actually.

49
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,210
Where does this end?

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,500
Ends right here.

51
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,520
That should be okay.

52
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,880
Sorry for the confusion.

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,590
There's a dive right here that starts right here.

54
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,480
So this actually should be.

55
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,300
This should end right here.

56
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,510
So sorry for the confusion, everybody.

57
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,740
And honestly, I don't even think we need that div.

58
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,890
We can probably just remove it, but we'll just leave it just for for the sake of leaving it.

59
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,710
So let's go ahead over here and we'll just grab this car hero and let's go over here and let's create

60
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,130
another component.

61
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,750
Now the issue is we already have a hero component.

62
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,700
So what we can do now is we can just say, add another directory, we can call this details.

63
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,020
So car detail.

64
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,410
And then over here we can just say Hero dot view and I'm going to go over here, just add a template

65
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,260
and add all of that HTML within there.

66
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:52,060
And then over here I can just say car and then it's detail and then hero.

67
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,670
And if I were to go ahead and render that and refresh, you can see I still get the exact same thing.

68
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,820
And I believe I can probably get rid of this div as well as this.

69
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,260
So let's go ahead and do that.

70
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,360
Let's go ahead and refresh.

71
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,650
Yeah, everything is looking good.

72
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,350
Okay, so now let's go to the attributes.

73
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,740
So let's go here.

74
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,420
We're going to go ahead and cut that out.

75
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,630
And we're also going to put that in the details directory.

76
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:24,940
We're going to say attributes dot view and let's create a template.

77
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,950
Go ahead and create that.

78
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,900
And then over here we're going to say.

79
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,880
Just right below this, we're going to say car detail, attributes, attributes.

80
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,660
So now we can go ahead and get rid of these comments.

81
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,160
And now let's do the description as well.

82
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,830
So we're going to go here, grab that description.

83
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,680
Let's go back over here.

84
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,800
We'll say description.

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,120
Dot view.

86
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,880
Go ahead and create a template for this template.

87
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,050
Paste that in there.

88
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,520
Save that.

89
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,930
And of course, the contact as well is the last thing that we need.

90
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,930
So let's grab that contact and let's go back up here.

91
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:16,790
We'll say contact dot view template and we'll say paste that in there.

92
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,420
All right.

93
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,340
So that's pretty much it.

94
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:29,090
So now we can just say car detail and we'll say description and then car detail contact.

95
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,350
There we go.

96
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,610
Looking good.

97
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,660
Looking good.

98
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:38,710
So we have pretty much created all of our different pages as well as the components for them.

99
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,830
We should be extremely happy at this point.

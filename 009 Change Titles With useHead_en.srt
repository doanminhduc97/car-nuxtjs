1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,960
The last thing that I would like to do in this section is change the titles of each particular page.

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,340
So if you were to look at your tabs right now, you can see we get this really ugly title Local host

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,970
3002 slash city slash auto slash car slash make.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:26,820
Not a very pretty title and same over here you know nothing about this is pretty at all So I want to

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:34,560
go ahead and actually change the titles and it is going to be remarkably easy to do with NOx three.

6
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:42,660
So let's go over here and I'm going to go to the let's go to rates over here.

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,400
Let's go to our very first page.

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,310
And I want to change the title so that as soon as you go to the home page, it should say car trader.

9
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,810
So over here, what we're going to do is we're going to create a script tag.

10
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,250
We're going to say setup.

11
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,740
Are we going to use a built in NOx composable called use head?

12
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,420
We're going to go ahead and invoke this and then we're going to pass in a bunch of options.

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,170
Specifically, we're going to pass in the title option.

14
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,840
And then over here we're going to say car trader like so.

15
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,580
And that's actually all it is that we need to do.

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,430
So now, if you look at your actual tab over here, you can see that it says car trader rather than

17
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,260
localhost 3000.

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,960
So now let's go ahead and actually do the exact same thing over here.

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,780
So I'm going to go to Ottawa and I am going to search over here and we're not getting anything.

20
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,380
And there we go.

21
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,950
I'm not sure why that was happening.

22
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,080
Let's go back here.

23
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,600
Let's search Ottawa.

24
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,300
There we go.

25
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,000
So it was just a little glitch there.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,410
And I actually want to change this so that well, what do we have over here?

27
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:52,230
So if I go to Toronto, what I want it to have, I want it to say cars in Ottawa.

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,170
So cars in Ottawa, that's what I wanted to say.

29
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:06,450
So let's go over here to that particular page, which is going to be this page right here.

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,289
So we're going to go to this page and we're going to go.

31
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,220
Over here.

32
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,390
Are we going to say script setup?

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,620
And we're going to go ahead and just say use head.

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,120
And we're going to say title and this is going to be a dynamic title.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,730
So we're going to say cars and then in and then auto, well, we're going to grab it from the root.

36
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,880
So we're going to say const root is equal to use root like so.

37
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,010
And we're going to say cars in and then we're going to say root.

38
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:51,150
And to actually grab the city, we're going to say slash params and then slash city, because that's

39
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,780
what we called it here city, the variable name.

40
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,480
And we're also going to capitalize this in case it's not capitalized, we're going to say dot two and

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,650
then we're going to say oh two.

42
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,340
Okay, So we can't necessarily there's no function to capitalize this.

43
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,480
So this is what we're going to do.

44
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,220
We're going to do this on the fly here.

45
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,260
We're going to say JavaScript.

46
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:27,180
Gonna say JavaScript function to capitalize, to capitalize, or we're just going to say that.

47
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,570
Okay, let's see if that works.

48
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,490
So we're going to go to Stack Overflow.

49
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,870
And.

50
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,690
All right.

51
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,910
This is going to capitalize.

52
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:40,660
All right.

53
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,970
So that's going to capitalize the first letter.

54
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,740
Not really what I want here.

55
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,720
I wanted to capitalize everything.

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,460
So capitalize.

57
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,810
Let's just say title.

58
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,570
Convert string to tidal case with JavaScript.

59
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,150
All right.

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,620
So let's see here.

61
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:58,820
Okay.

62
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,120
This looks like a good solution.

63
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:07,350
So we'll just say to Title case, just grab this function over here and I am going to just put this

64
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,660
function right here and we're going to say.

65
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,029
We're just going to wrap this with two title case to title case.

66
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,270
I'm going to go ahead and add that in there.

67
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,960
Okay.

68
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,300
So now we should see.

69
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,410
If I were to go back here.

70
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,980
You see, we get cars in Ottawa.

71
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,420
But actually I want to make this a little bit more dynamic.

72
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,360
So if I actually add the make instead of having cars, I want to say something like Buicks in Ottawa.

73
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,500
So if I add Buicks, it should say Buicks in Ottawa.

74
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,940
So this actually is going to be pretty easy as well.

75
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,720
So we're just going to go over here and we're just going to say dollar sign.

76
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,140
And this time we need to check if the route dot params dot MC is even there.

77
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:03,130
So if we have the MC itself, then what we want to do is we want to say to title case and actually pass

78
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,310
in the route dot params dot.

79
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,440
Make else.

80
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,520
What we want to do is we'll just say cars, just generic cars.

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,210
All right.

82
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,490
So that's pretty much all it is that we need to do.

83
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,190
So I'm just going to kind of let me zoom out of here a bit so you can really see that zoom out so you

84
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,960
can kind of see the whole thing.

85
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,720
And actually if I save, you can see that auto saved it.

86
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,730
So this is how it should look.

87
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,280
So now you can see it says cars and auto.

88
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,830
But if I go to slash Buicks, it says Buicks in auto or Buick in Ottawa, plural.

89
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,770
Okay, So this is great.

90
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:45,430
And now the last thing that I want to do is whenever I click on a particular a particular car, it should

91
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:52,210
take me to the slash car and then slash whatever, let's say was Buick and then five.

92
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,260
So this is just going to be the actual name of the car itself.

93
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:02,960
So let's go over here and we're going to also use the use head for this.

94
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,770
So what does this say script set up?

95
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,570
And we'll say use head and title.

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,790
And this one, we're going to say, let's go ahead and just say const root.

97
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,920
Is equal to use route.

98
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,580
And then over here, we're just going to say the name of the car itself.

99
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:36,190
So it's just going to be routes, dot params, dot and params dot.

100
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,630
And then the the actual name of the car, which is the name.

101
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,110
Now of course I'm going to want to title case this as well.

102
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,720
So what we're going to do is we're going to grab this function and what we'll think of we'll have a

103
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,700
better way if actually putting this function in one place instead of having it in just, you know,

104
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,710
copying and pasting it throughout components.

105
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,090
But for now, we'll just do that.

106
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:04,600
So we're going to go over here and we'll just title case this and now you can say Buick right over here.

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,180
Okay, So this is looking pretty, pretty good.

108
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,770
And that actually concludes the section on file base routing.

00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,500
In this video.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,280
What I want to do is focus in on this page right over here.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,650
So right now, the path is slash city slash Ottawa slash car.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:17,460
Now, let's quickly talk about exactly which portion of this page is going to change the most whenever

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,080
we change the path.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,450
Well, this sidebar is going to change very, very little.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,280
It's still going to have the location to make the price.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,910
But maybe these values are going to be different and they're just going to be extracted from the route

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,570
itself.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,590
So this is going to change very, very little.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,700
However, it's going to be this portion that changes dramatically.

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,230
So if I change it from Ottawa to Toronto, we're going to have a bunch of different cars that exist

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,290
in Toronto rather than Ottawa.

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,390
If I change it from Toyota to Volvo, then we're only going to show Volvo cars.

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,680
So I think what we need to do is change our routing structure so that this portion right over here that

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,920
changes the most is actually going to be a nested route.

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,190
So let me go ahead and quickly try to explain this by well, going through it.

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,800
So right over here, we're going to go to our city.

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:21,210
And remember, we have the city slash dynamic city slash car and then make now within this city directory,

20
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,700
I'm going to create another file and I'm going to call this car dot view.

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,660
So car view like so.

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,730
And this is actually going to conflict with the car view that we have over here, because then this

23
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:40,470
is going to be slash city slash well the dynamic city slash car and then and this should be and then

24
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,960
over here we have the slash car dot view.

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,270
And then over here we also have slash city slash dynamic city and then slash car.

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,870
And we also have an optional make.

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,510
So it's going to conflict and we'll fix that confliction a little bit later.

28
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,290
So we're going to add a template here and we're pretty much going to add exactly what we had.

29
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,030
But this time inside of this car dot view file.

30
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,650
So I'm going to go ahead, add the nav bar, I'm going to add the div, we're going to add the car,

31
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,730
car side bar, but now we're going to do so.

32
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,490
Now what we're going to do is right over here, instead of actually rendering the car cards, what we're

33
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,690
going to do is we're going to render a nux page.

34
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,540
So a nux page like so.

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,660
And then over here within our make, we're going to remove all of this stuff.

36
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,630
So we're going to remove the nav bar.

37
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,030
So let's remove the nav bar, we're going to remove this some, remove that, let's remove this, We're

38
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,700
going to literally keep, we're going to remove everything except for the car card and maybe have a

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,600
div right here.

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,560
So that div.

41
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,420
So that's, that's what we're going to do.

42
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,260
And so what's going to happen now is we're going to go to it's going to render the car view file and

43
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,410
then we're going to have this nux page and now any other path that we have in there.

44
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,800
So right now we're at the slash car and any other path over here that we have is going to actually render

45
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,290
right here inside of this Nux page.

46
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,840
So initially the root nux page is going to render all of our different pages, but now any other path

47
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,690
that is after car is going to be rendered in this nux page because we have this nested route.

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,620
Now in this case we actually do have a slash car slash make which is dynamic and optional and so it's

49
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,120
going to go ahead and render this.

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,300
So eventually we're going to actually achieve the exact same thing.

51
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,340
So let me just go ahead and prove this to you by doing a little quick refresh and tada, you can see

52
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,090
we still have our make and we still have our car.

53
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:50,010
And just to kind of really make this as clear as possible, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to remove

54
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,270
this nux page.

55
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,480
And now you can see that that component is completely gone.

56
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,880
So if I were to add it back, it is back.

57
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,150
And now let me just go ahead and actually just rename this for now to like make but static.

58
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,540
And so now if I go to slash whatever, it's not going to know what that page is.

59
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,600
However, if I go to slash make, it's going to know what that page is and it's going to render that.

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,380
And if I go ahead and add another page and I'll just say Hello dot view and I'm just going to say template

61
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,190
div and then H one hello, whatever.

62
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:34,980
And now if I go to Slash Hello, you can see I'm going to have to refresh the page here, unfortunately,

63
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,240
or maybe refresh it.

64
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,080
I think it should work.

65
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,130
Nope, does not.

66
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,450
So let's go over here.

67
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,950
Let's refresh the whole thing.

68
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,650
It's kind of unfortunate that it makes me refreshed the whole time because I'm going to have to delete

69
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,480
those later.

70
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:56,890
But now I hope you guys can understand if I go to slash scar slash Hello as it loads up.

71
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,680
Just play with the circle.

72
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,960
You can see now we get this over here.

73
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,530
So if I change this back to make sure we get that.

74
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,100
All right?

75
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,930
So I hope that it is nice and clear.

76
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,640
So I'm going to go ahead and just delete this for now.

77
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,840
We do not need that.

78
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,960
So we remove the trash and we're going to rename this back to what it was before.

79
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,680
So I hope you guys get the point of nested components.

1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,939
Now that we have made this nice and dynamic, we could potentially run into an error.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,090
So let's say that a user decides to search for a car that has an ID that doesn't really exist in our

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,020
JSON file.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,610
So I'm just going to put seven, seven, seven, seven, I'm going to press enter and you can see right

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,100
away we kind of get this blank screen.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,580
And that's really because right over where is it?

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,660
Right over.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,830
Where are we here?

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,970
Kind of forgot.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,450
Right in the cards.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,340
So in the cards right over here, we actually have a VRF and actually it's right over here.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,260
So we have this VRF.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,780
Now, if we didn't have this VRF, we're probably going to even run into a boatload of other issues.

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,070
So if I were to refresh, you can see here now we're getting a 500 error and it's actually going back

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,460
to that really nice error dot view file.

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,960
And you can see here that hey I cannot read property undefined of URL.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:03,390
Now of course if I go back to a actual page you can see that everything is completely fine.

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:12,960
So what I want to do is when a user actually goes to an ID that is not of a car that exists in our JSON

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,690
file, I want to throw a custom error so we don't have that 500 error.

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,110
So right over here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say if car value doesn't exist.

21
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,190
So if we can't find that particular car, the car is going to be null.

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,230
So I'm just going to say if it doesn't exist, what I'm going to do is I'm going to throw and then I'm

23
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,050
going to say throw, create error.

24
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,070
And this just allows us to create a nux error.

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,950
So I'm going to say over here, status code, I'm going to say 400 oh four and then for the message

26
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:56,010
I'm going to say, well, let's make this a nice dynamic message and I'm going to say car with ID,

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:09,720
I'll just say ID off and over here we'll just do rho dot params dot id and we'll say does not exist.

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,640
And so this is actually how we can go ahead and throw custom errors.

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,840
And so now any time I go to a page like this, you can see now I get a 404 and this time it's not a

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,230
404 page not found because this is actually a page that exists within our directory.

31
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,600
So this is an actual valid page.

32
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,420
However, we just can't find a car.

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,720
So it's still if 404 something was not found and now you can see the error message is a little bit different.

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,740
And let me just go ahead and actually capitalize this because it looks a little bit nicer so you can

35
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,780
see the powers of this.

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,640
So now what I can do is I can actually go ahead and go back and do whatever it is that I want.

37
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:59,310
However, once I create an error, that error is actually going to persist throughout the application.

38
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,090
So ideally, inside of the error view file, we actually clear that error.

39
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:14,820
And so we can actually do that by well, going over here and I can just say very simply, clear error.

40
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:21,810
So I can clear this error and also I can pass in an option, a redirect option to redirect me back to

41
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,070
the slash home page.

42
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,450
So that's going to clear that error.

43
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,370
So we don't have that error anymore.

44
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,930
So now let's go back over here.

45
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,650
I'll just search for auto and over here.

46
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm just going to go and search for this portion and then I'm going to change this up to like five,

47
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,290
five, five.

48
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,060
You can see a car with this ID and we can actually go back and it clears the error itself.

49
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,200
So this is how we can throw custom errors within nux.

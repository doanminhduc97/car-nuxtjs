00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,810
Attached to this lecture.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,970
You should have a class dot JSON file.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:13,270
So what I want you to do is to go ahead and download it and then in your root directory, create a data

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,270
directory and put that cast JSON file within it.

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,320
Now the data directory is not a special directory.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,360
It's not something that Knox looks for.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,990
I just think it's a nice name to store our data.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:33,130
So over here we have our castle JSON file and you can see that it is an array of objects and each object

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,770
has information about a particular car.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:41,650
So it has the ID, the name, the price, the URL seats, miles features, and the description.

11
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:48,070
So what we're going to do is we're going to actually utilize this data right over here to render our

12
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,570
car cards right over here rather than have one static card.

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,420
So let's actually go ahead and do that.

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,160
Now, one thing that I would like to do in order to really organize everything is I'm going to create

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,390
a composable and this is going to be called use cars dot JS.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,300
So let's go over here.

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,170
We're going to say const export use cars.

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,540
It's going to be an arrow function.

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:20,620
And over here what a very simply want to do is just import this data and just return it from this function.

20
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,530
So what we can do is at the very top of the file, we can just say import cars and then specify the

21
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,720
path to that directory.

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,560
So we can say dot, dot, slash to go to the root directory and then we can go to Stata.

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,510
And then over here, cars.

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,100
And then very simply now we can just say return cars like so.

25
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,980
However, one thing that we can actually do to optimize the import statement is because we are going

26
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:55,420
back to the root directory, we can actually kind of forego these dot dots and instead we can say at

27
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,470
and what this is going to do.

28
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,090
Once we say add, it's going to take us right to the root directory and then I'm going to say, okay,

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,500
from the root directory I want to go to data and then cars dot JSON.

30
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:05,920
Okay.

31
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,710
So that's pretty much all it is that we need to do.

32
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,580
And now I actually want to make use of this composable.

33
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:20,860
So let's go to the cards and over here let's create a script setup and I'm going to go ahead and just

34
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,390
grab this information.

35
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,770
So I'm going to say I want to get the cars from use cars.

36
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:34,480
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say V four over here and I'm going to say car in cars.

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,550
And we'll also have a key here and we'll say car dot ID And I think that's pretty much all it is that

38
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,850
we need.

39
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,160
And actually we have to also pass the props in.

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,500
So we'll just say car like so.

41
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,310
All right.

42
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,450
So now we should get three different cars and we don't.

43
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,580
And actually I think that's because over here inside of the make we're actually rendering the card and

44
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,720
not the cards.

45
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,140
So now if I were to save that, you can see we have three different cars.

46
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,100
But of course the data is static because we're not using the props.

47
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,960
So let's go back over here.

48
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,040
Let's go to the card and let's actually make use of those props.

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,670
So I'm going to say script, I'm going to say set up and over here I'm going to say const and I'll say

50
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:26,370
props is equal to define props, and we'll go ahead and just invoke that like so.

51
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:34,300
And over here, actually we'll just do an object and we'll just say car, and this is going to be an

52
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,740
object like so.

53
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,370
All right.

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,450
So now if I were to render car.

55
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,530
We should see all the information about that particular car.

56
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,460
There we go.

57
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:51,000
So let's go ahead and actually make this dynamic.

58
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,960
So for the source, I'm going to make this dynamic.

59
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,640
And over here, I'm just going to say car dot.

60
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,790
And I'll say, what did I call it here?

61
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,610
I believe I called it URL.

62
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,300
I'll just get rid of this.

63
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,300
Get rid of this, get rid of this, get rid of this or that.

64
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,640
So car dot URL.

65
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,760
So let's go over here.

66
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,270
Car URL.

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,830
That looks good to me.

68
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:23,930
And we'll say car dot and what I call this here car dot name for this.

69
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,170
And then over here, car description.

70
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,040
So say card dot descript shun.

71
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:39,740
And lastly, right over here we'll say car dot price.

72
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,420
Nice and easy stuff.

73
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:49,820
Okay, so now if I were to do a quick little refresh, you can see that everything is nice and dynamic.

74
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,570
So what I would like to do is actually now make these cards clickable.

75
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,120
So when I click on them, they actually go to the correct page.

76
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,700
So right over, we'll say right over here.

77
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,940
We might change this later on and I'll show you exactly why.

78
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,520
But right now we'll just add an add click.

79
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,280
And very simply, what we'll say is I want to navigate.

80
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:19,190
So navigate to and I want to navigate to and we'll add template literals here.

81
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,690
And where do we want to navigate?

82
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:31,220
Well, we want to navigate to slash car and then slash and then over here we will say car dot name and

83
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,630
then remember it's going to be dash and then the car dot ID.

84
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,380
All right.

85
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,500
So let's go ahead and quickly save that.

86
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:44,390
And now, if I were to click on this, you can see now I get taken to the actual car page.

87
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:51,290
So now that we got that dynamic, let's actually make this page over here dynamic rather than kind of

88
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,650
having rendering all of these static information.

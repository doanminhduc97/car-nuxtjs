1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,680
In order to actually customize the data, we must search for the particular object that has the ID that

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,320
is present right over here.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,990
So let's go ahead and actually extract that ID first and foremost.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,340
So let's go to our pages directory.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,720
So components, composable files right here, pages.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,680
And I'm going to go to car, just go to this particular page right over here.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,040
And you can see that we're actually already using this use route.

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,080
Now let's use route.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,260
We're extracting the name from it, but we can also extract the I D And just to prove this to you,

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,100
I'm going to go ahead and right over here I'm just going to say route dot params dot ID, I remember

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,170
that's because we called it ID right here.

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,190
And I can see right here very faintly we have a two.

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,970
Okay, so we got the ID, but now what I want to do is I want to well search for that particular car

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:05,900
by its ID, so let's actually go ahead and create a computed value here and I'm going to say const and

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:13,410
I'll say car and I'll say that this is going to be equal to computed, computed.

16
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,430
And notice again that we can auto import computed.

17
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,890
And what we're going to do here in this function is very simply iterate over all of those cars and find

18
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,430
the one that has the ID that is within this route.

19
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,190
So to actually get access to those cars, we'll just say cars from or not from.

20
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,820
We'll just use the composable.

21
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,150
We'll just say use cars like.

22
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,520
So we're going to go ahead and invoke that.

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:48,690
And over here very simply, we'll just do is we'll return cars dot find and over here we'll say see.

24
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,050
And we shall return.

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,360
The C dot id is equal to.

26
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,180
We're going to do pass int because this ID even though it is really a number once we extracted from

27
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,660
the parameters, it will be a type of string.

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,300
So we have to parse enter into it.

29
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:16,050
And then over here we're going to say just root dot params, dot ID, All right.

30
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,700
That's all it is that we need to do.

31
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,190
And now what we can do here.

32
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,540
Is very simply just grab Oh, my goodness.

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,940
I'm just trying to grab whatever I give up.

34
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,230
Let's go over here.

35
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,470
I'm just going to grab the car here for now.

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,740
Let's go ahead and save that.

37
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,330
You can see we do indeed get the card details.

38
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:34,740
All right.

39
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,610
So let's actually go ahead and only render this if we have the car.

40
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,970
So let's just go here and just say if car and if we don't have the car, we can just render something

41
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,330
else.

42
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,580
And I'll show you exactly what we're going to do later on.

43
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,640
So now what we need to do is unfortunately pass in a lot of different props.

44
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,280
Now we can pass in the car prop to every single one.

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,140
That is completely fine.

46
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:06,360
And actually it's probably not the best idea being that, you know, some some of these components don't

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,330
really need all of the information.

48
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:15,810
So over here, for example, we can probably pass the whole car component into the car hero because

49
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,670
the car hero has a lot of information.

50
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:25,050
The the it has the image, it has the the name, the seats, the miles, the the price.

51
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,500
You know, it doesn't really matter if you pass in a little bit more information.

52
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,530
But for the other ones, we don't really need to pass everything.

53
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,920
We really just need to pass maybe the features.

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,040
So the car dot features like so.

55
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,830
And then over here.

56
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,490
We'll just pass a description.

57
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,380
So we'll say description.

58
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,970
And then over here we'll say car dot description.

59
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,450
So that's pretty much all it is that we need to pass in.

60
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,040
So now let's actually utilize these within the actual components themselves.

61
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,360
So let's go over here to components car.

62
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:05,990
Let's begin with the car hero and actually car detail hero is specifically what we're going to be using.

63
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:16,100
So let's go over here to script setup and we're going to say cons, props, and we'll say for this,

64
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,420
this is going to be defined props.

65
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,120
So define props.

66
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,340
And we'll just say car is going to be an object.

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,230
So again, over here now what we can do is very simply.

68
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,080
Extract this so it can be car dot URL, I believe it's called.

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,470
And now if I were to refresh this, you can see now we actually get the URL itself over here.

70
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:53,960
We can say car dot name over here, we can say car dot seats over here.

71
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,150
We can just talk about how many miles.

72
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,820
So a car dot miles.

73
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:06,170
And lastly here, car dot price.

74
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:06,950
All right.

75
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,190
So that's pretty much it for that.

76
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,100
So now let me just copy this.

77
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,220
Let's go to the attributes.

78
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:26,860
So the attributes and really all it is is a features array, so features and we can just say array for

79
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,520
this.

80
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,680
And just to show you what the features are, it's just an array of all of the different features of

81
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,580
the cars.

82
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:39,610
So what we can do now is we can go back to attributes and then right here we can just iterate over this

83
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,150
with av4, so we can just say V four.

84
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,790
And we can say feature in features.

85
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,580
And each feature is going to be unique, so we can use the actual feature itself as a key.

86
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,440
So you can just say feature.

87
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,900
And then over here we can say feature.

88
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,600
And let's just do a quick little refresh.

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,060
There we go.

90
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,090
So now we get all of those different features.

91
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,160
Last thing we need is the description.

92
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,370
So let's go here and let's go back to the attributes.

93
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,590
Copy this.

94
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,420
Paste that in there.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,660
All right.

96
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:31,570
And this is just going to be a string, so let's just grab that and description like so.

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,640
So now I'm going to go ahead and just remove this and I'll just say description.

98
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,670
Description.

99
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,000
So I'm going to go and save that.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,570
And there we go.

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,540
Now, you can see we have this description.

102
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,500
So this is looking pretty good.

103
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,730
We have made everything nice and dynamic.

00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,480
All right, everybody, welcome to a brand new section.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,140
And in this section, we're going to mainly focus in on cleaning up our code a little bit.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,379
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to begin with looking into all of the different view files that

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,480
pertain to our pages.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,640
So let's go into our pages directory.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,720
And what I did is I opened up the indexed view, which is the home page.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,790
I then opened up the car view, which is going to be the car listing page.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:36,240
And then I opened up this page over here, the name Dash ID dot view, which is actually the car itself.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,720
And I want to kind of just explore the code at this point.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,800
So let's begin with the indexed view, and I want to focus in on the HTML, not the script tag.

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,600
So let's go over here.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,210
So we have the template, we have the div, and over here we have our nav bar component and then we

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,120
have our car hero.

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,600
So let's actually look at a common pattern when we go to the car out view.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:08,040
So we have our template, we have our div and then we have our nav bar at the very top and then we have

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,080
our div that's going to contain all of the HTML that pertains to this page.

17
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,580
Now if I go back over here, you can see the exact same thing.

18
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,720
We have our nav bar and then we have a div that contains all of the different components that live inside

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,800
of this page.

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,260
So what are we noticing here?

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,600
We're noticing kind of a common pattern.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:40,560
So throughout these three pages we always render the nav bar component and importantly, very importantly,

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,360
we always render it in the exact same position.

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,150
So it's always at the very top.

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,220
So you can see here the nav bar component is at the very top, the nav bar component is at the very

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,520
top and the nav bar is component that is at the very top.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:04,140
And most likely if we add more and more pages, we're going to want to have that nav bar component be

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,160
at the very top.

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,310
And of course we are going to want to render it.

30
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:16,020
So why wouldn't it be nice if we can somehow abstract this away, if somehow we don't have to actually

31
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:23,880
render the nav bar for every single page we can just have nux figure out that I want to have a nav bar

32
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,550
for every single page and I want it to be located at the very top of the page.

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,370
So how can we do that?

34
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,470
Well, we can actually do that with something known as layouts.

35
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:45,870
So layouts allow us to lay out our page and we can also have a default layout.

36
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,870
And I think it will make a lot more sense once we actually go ahead and code out our very first layout.

37
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,120
So layouts only work inside of a layout directory.

38
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,920
So let's go ahead and create directory and it has to be called layouts.

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,230
And as you can imagine, it's going to be very similar reason as to why this has to be called component

40
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,150
and why this has to be called pages.

41
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,060
Knox is going to understand that the view files inside of this layouts directory are layouts, and it's

42
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,250
going to do some magic behind the scenes.

43
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,900
So let's go ahead over here and we're going to do layouts and we're going to create a new file.

44
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,870
Now, typically, we don't really care what we call the file.

45
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,870
I guess in the pages we do care depending on the path.

46
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,000
But over here, this actually matters a lot.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,440
We have to call it default dot view to define a default layout that is going to exist for every single

48
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,180
page in our application.

49
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:45,090
So let's go ahead and create that page and this is just going to be a regular well view file.

50
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,280
So we're going to have a template, a div.

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,910
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to define at the very top, I always want to render the nav

52
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,540
bar.

53
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,780
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to define the slot component.

54
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,880
Now this isn't any nux specific component.

55
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,390
This is something that we already see in Vue three.

56
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:13,380
It is is in essence what this is, is all of the HTML that is going to be housed right over here inside

57
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,120
of these specific files.

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,019
So right now the slot component would be all of this HTML right over here.

59
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,290
Similarly, the slot component will be this over here.

60
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,480
So now what we're saying is, Hey, I want the nav bar and I want everything all the other HTML that's

61
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,770
rendered over here.

62
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,870
So let's go ahead and actually save those.

63
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,210
And in order to actually get this to work, we need to go over here to the app dot view and we need

64
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,030
to wrap this with a nux layout.

65
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,410
Just saying that hey, I want my nux page to use the Knox layout.

66
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,730
So let's go over here.

67
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,850
And right away we actually notice something interesting.

68
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,590
We have two nav bars and then we have our hero right over here.

69
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:59,550
And if I were to click on let's say Toronto now where to go search, you can see again two nav bars

70
00:04:59,550 --> 00:04:59,740
and we.

71
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,150
Have our research and if I were to click on a specific car.

72
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,150
Oh, yeah.

73
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,500
We didn't make this clickable yet.

74
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,460
Yeah, that's later on.

75
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,210
Don't worry.

76
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,250
Uh, let's go over here.

77
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,570
We'll say car and we'll just go to Jeep one.

78
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,810
And over here you can see we have two nav bars, and this actually makes sense.

79
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,740
So what this is doing is it's taking this default layout.

80
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,730
And where is that?

81
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,530
It's taking this default layout and it's applying it to every single page.

82
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:37,040
So what it's doing is it's adding this nav bar and then it's adding all of the HTML that is within the

83
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,730
page, and that also includes an additional nav bar.

84
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,950
So the whole point of adding the layout is so we can remove the need of adding that additional nav bar.

85
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,300
So I'm going to go ahead and actually do that so we don't have those double nav bars.

86
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,150
So I'm going to go ahead and remove those double nav bars and let's go over here.

87
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,690
And we're going to go ahead and remove that.

88
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,460
And there we go.

89
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,950
So now you can see we have pretty much drastically cleaned up our code.

90
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,660
And you can imagine if our Linux application is getting huge.

91
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,060
Maybe we have 100 different pages now.

92
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,190
We don't have to add that nav bar component at the very top every single time.

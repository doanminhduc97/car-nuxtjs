1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,510
Another thing that I would like to clean up is this right over here?

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,710
So you can see that this function, we're using it in multiple different places.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,010
So we're using it right over here in this page.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,040
We're also using it right over here in this page.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,860
So what I would like to do is kind of abstract it and put it in one file so we can just use it and import

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,440
it into the files that we need.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,480
And what we can do is we can actually store this function, this functionality that we're going to utilize

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,860
throughout multiple different components or pages or both.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,710
We can actually store them in composable so composable sort of places where we can store state as well

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,680
as a different pieces of functionality.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,780
So I'm going to go over here, I'm going to create a composable directory and it has to be called composable

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,910
because Knox is going to understand that all of the different files in here are composable and do the

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,230
auto importing and I'm going to call this composable file use utility.

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,050
So typically composable start with use.

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,290
And over here I'm going to say use U DT Lee.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,690
I'm a I'm trying to spell this correctly.

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,320
Utilities.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,580
I think that's how you spell it.

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,330
And then when I say dot JS, so this is just going to be a regular function that we are going to export.

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,870
So we're going to say use utilities and this is just going to be a regular function like so and we're

21
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,660
going to grab this piece of functionality which is going to be the two title case and we're going to

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,920
place that in there.

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,650
And then at the very bottom of the function, we're going to return it.

24
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,720
So we're going to say to Title case.

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,600
So everything should be working A-OK now.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,730
But now what we can do is instead of defining the function over here, what we can do is actually utilize

27
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:49,020
that composable so we can say const curly braces for do structuring, use utilities, and we can go

28
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,900
ahead and invoke it and we can actually get to title case that to title case function.

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,330
And now we can go ahead and remove this.

30
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:03,180
And now if I were to actually refresh, you can see that everything is still capitalized in the tab

31
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,370
and we can actually do the exact same thing.

32
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:11,220
Now, in the other case where we use it, which is going to be the this file right over here.

33
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,060
So over here we have use title case.

34
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,810
And we use that right over here in the use head as well.

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,090
So instead, I'm going to go ahead and just paste that in there and I'm going to remove this, save

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,470
that, and I'm going to go to G.

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,950
Let's go to slash car slash Jeep slash one, and you can see that Jeep is still capitalized.

38
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:43,030
So we can use comparables to kind of abstract away all of this repetitive code, which is always great.

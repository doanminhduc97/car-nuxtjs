1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,410
So we learned about layouts, which is great.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,870
You can see it's a really nice way to clean up our code.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,800
However, right now I'm going to go ahead and just focus in on some of these pages over here.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,020
So let's first look at this page over here.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,470
So we have our nav bar and we also have this hero.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,230
And then let's go to this page right here.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,350
Now, you can see we have the nav bar, but you can see that all of the content, no matter how much

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:35,160
content that we have, is always going to be confined from right over here to right over here.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,560
So right here to right here.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,700
And it's not going to spend the entire width of our screen.

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,190
And if I were to go to let's say I'm going to go let's just pick a car here.

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,710
So slash, slash car and then we're going to say Jeep one.

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,050
You can see here, this is the exact same thing.

14
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,130
So it's always going to span right over here.

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,820
It's not going to we're always going to have these white spaces and it's going to span kind of right

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,660
in the middle.

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,280
And this is actually done by having this div element right here.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,330
So this div has all of the tailwind classes that are needed to have that stylistic effect.

19
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:23,820
And the only really exist in right now two of our pages, our main page doesn't have this exact div,

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,890
this exact div element.

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:33,690
Now in cases where we have maybe some pages, you know, a group of pages that follow a particular layout,

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:39,750
but others that don't, we obviously don't want to have a default layout for all of them, but instead

23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:47,130
what we want to do is we want to have a custom layout and then apply that custom layout to those group

24
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,110
of pages.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:56,010
So again, in our case, these two pages have this div right over here and I think it would be nice

26
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,770
to kind of abstract it into a layout.

27
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,110
So again, what we're going to need to do is define a custom layout and let's go ahead and do that.

28
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,960
So custom layout can be called whatever it is that we want and call them banana dot view, whatever

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,470
dot view.

30
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,740
I'm just going to go ahead and just call them custom dot view just to kind of kind of ensure in your

31
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,160
mind that this is a custom layout.

32
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,650
I'm going to go ahead and just define the div, the template, and then I am going to go and grab this

33
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,820
div right here.

34
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,610
So go ahead and just grab that.

35
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,830
I'm going to go ahead and paste it in here.

36
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,130
So I'm going to go ahead and paste it in here and let's add the closing div as well.

37
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:42,180
So closing div like so and so over here is where I'm going to house the slot.

38
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,480
So over here is where I'm going to house the slot like so.

39
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:52,680
So now what I want to do is I want to actually utilize this custom layout within these two pages.

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,110
So what we're going to need to do is actually override the default layout.

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,230
And to do that, we can define.

42
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,470
And we can define the.

43
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,210
Let me just scroll down here.

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,230
We can go ahead and define the page meta.

45
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,210
This is something that is auto imported.

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,890
And over here, we're going to call it, and we're going to pass in the object, which is going to be

47
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,590
the meta.

48
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,500
And we're going to specify the layout.

49
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,250
And the layout is going to be the name of the file, in this case, custom.

50
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,260
So let's go ahead and actually save this.

51
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,210
And if I were to refresh.

52
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,170
You can see we get this really wonky effect.

53
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,040
And the reason why we're getting this effect here is now what we're going to need to do is remove this

54
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,550
right here.

55
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,750
So let's remove this div because we don't need that anymore.

56
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,710
And if I were to save it now you can see it looks exactly the same, except it doesn't have the knife

57
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,190
bar.

58
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,340
So it's very important to understand that what we did here was we overwritten the default layout, so

59
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,230
we're not going to be using that anymore.

60
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,810
So if we still want to have the nav bar in our custom layouts, we're going to need to specify it.

61
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,950
So very simply, we can just say here, nav bar like so.

62
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,530
And now we have our nav bar and over here you can see that the code is actually getting significantly

63
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:11,940
less.

64
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,410
It's a lot nicer now.

65
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,390
We don't have that big div that's in our way.

66
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,260
We just have the parent div and we have all of this content as well.

67
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,880
So you can see our code is getting significantly cleaner and we can do it.

68
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,750
Of course the exact same thing over here.

69
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:34,750
So we can instead say, define uh and then it was cost or defined page meta.

70
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,790
And over here we can say layout.

71
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,590
I'm going to say custom.

72
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,110
And now we can go ahead and just remove this div.

73
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,080
So let's remove that div.

74
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,550
We'll remove this.

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,630
And there we go.

76
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,650
That's pretty much all it is that we need to do.

77
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:58,570
So now, if I were to go to here and let's just say Houston, Houston and search and you can see that

78
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,750
it looks a little bit wonky here.

79
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,960
So let's see why that is so define page meta.

80
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,700
We have the layout.

81
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,110
Let's do a refresh.

82
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,830
There we go.

83
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,920
So so it was just wasn't refreshed.

84
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:19,540
So you can see here now it is indeed working and we have significantly reduced the complexity of our

85
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,290
code.

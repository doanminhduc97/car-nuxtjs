1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,240
All right, everybody in this section we're going to do is focus in on error handling.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,990
So there are multiple different things that can occur within our application that could trigger an error.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,050
Now, we're going to look at a multiple throughout the section.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:23,460
However, I'm going to go ahead and focus in on one very specific and obvious error in this video.

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:32,580
And that is, well, what if a user decides to go to a page that does not really exist within our pages

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,420
directory?

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,420
So right now we all really only defined three different routes the home page and the car display page

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,820
as well as the car detail page.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,940
But what if the user decides to go and they can very easily do this to, you know, local host, 3000

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,450
slash banana and I'm going to go ahead and press enter.

11
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:58,500
And you can see here this actually triggers an error and specifically it triggers a404 error.

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,420
And that's exactly what this is.

13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,319
So if you know your status code, four or four stands for not found.

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:11,310
And specifically in this case, we have a page not found error and we do not understand this path right

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,240
over here.

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,730
Now, Knox is actually nice enough to give us this page right off the bat.

17
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,510
So any time we get this particular error, this is what we get.

18
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,380
And we have this nice, neat button that will allow us to go back home.

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,570
However, in most applications, we're not going to want to have this kind of default nux page.

20
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,020
We're going to probably want to have our own custom page.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,010
So how can we create our own custom error page?

22
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,750
Well, this is what we're going to do.

23
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,670
So write in the root directory, not in the page's directory.

24
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,470
In the root directory we're going to create a file called error dot to view.

25
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,090
And the name is very important.

26
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,280
It has to be called error dot view.

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,310
And then in here we're going to define our template.

28
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,620
So we're going to say div.

29
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,130
And then over here we're going to go ahead and say H one and we're just going to say error for now.

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,870
And what ends up happening is any time we have an error, whether it's a404 page error or any other

31
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,470
error that we might potentially have, it's going to go ahead and show this template right over here.

32
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,420
And to prove it to you, if I were to refresh, you can see now we have this blank screen and if I were

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,290
to zoom in, you can see this error state right over here.

34
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,070
So now what we can do is we can actually just make this a little bit prettier.

35
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,200
So let's just add a little bit of style.

36
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,290
So I'm going to say flex height screen.

37
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:46,110
We'll say justify center items, item center, and that should center everything right in the middle,

38
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,760
which is pretty nice for me.

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,830
And we're also, say flex calls just so we can change the direction.

40
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,690
And then over here, we can have text Excel, just make it nice and big over here where I'll just change

41
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,070
it to 404.

42
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,200
So we'll have 404 like so.

43
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,050
And we can also small.

44
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,820
We'll can change the color if we want, but I don't really want to do that.

45
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,000
And over here we can also have a message.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:25,500
So some sort of message so I can say class mt7 so we can have some margin on top and then Excel or text

47
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,520
for Excel.

48
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,530
And we'll just say Page not found something like that.

49
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,300
So Page not found.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,310
And then over here, let's also have a button that will allow us to go back.

51
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,710
So go back.

52
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:46,380
So I know we pretty much completely replicated what they had here.

53
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,680
So and their styles were definitely a lot better than us.

54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,250
But what I'm trying to show you is that we can have our own custom page by utilizing this error dot

55
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:56,850
view.

56
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,690
So let's go ahead and actually finish this off and then we'll talk about another thing a little bit

57
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,200
later.

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,750
So I'm going to just go ahead over here in the button.

59
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,760
Let's just make this nice and rounded.

60
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:23,400
Let's also add a margin top seven E to excel B, g dash blue 400 px7p, y four and then text white.

61
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,290
So we're going to go ahead and add that.

62
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,450
And now we have this cool little button.

63
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,760
And what I want to do is I'm going to click on this button.

64
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,760
I want to go back to the home page and we know how to do this now.

65
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,170
So we're going to say script setup, let's create a function.

66
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,140
I'm going to say const handle.

67
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:48,180
I'm going to say handle, return, handle, return or what we'll say handle error.

68
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,640
And then over here, we'll just very simply say, I want to go back.

69
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,780
So I'm just gonna say navigate to I'm going to say Slash.

70
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,610
So we're going to go over here.

71
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:07,350
And we're going to say it's click or we're going to go and we're going to say, handle air.

72
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,700
All right.

73
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,960
So let's go ahead and save this.

74
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,390
And now if I click on it, you can see I go right back.

75
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:20,300
So again, I have created basically a much uglier version of the original.

76
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,210
However, again, we can customize it to the way that we want.

77
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:30,770
Maybe for our car website we have like a sad car face or something like that, so we can customize it

78
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,480
the way that we want.
